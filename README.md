# Virtual Prototyping CMake projects

Use  *createProject.sh  project*  to create a new project folder with all files from the blank project.
Use *cmakeNormal.sh* or *cmakeVoid.sh* to start the cmake procedure (or just use *cmake*).

**Don't forget** to add   *export SYSTEMC=/directory/of/systemc*   to *~/.bashrc*
